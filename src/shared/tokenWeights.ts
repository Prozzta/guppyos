/**
 * GOD-STARTUP-TOKENS R3 (1.1.79): token figures a person reads as WORK.
 *
 * A Claude/Codex request re-sends the whole conversation, most of it served from the prompt cache.
 * The raw figure (input + output + cache read + cache write) counts every re-sent token in full,
 * so a startup that re-reads a 300K context for a dozen steps "used 4M tokens" while costing about
 * what 600K of fresh input would. The billed-equivalent figure weighs each kind by what the
 * provider charges relative to an input token:
 *   - cache read  x0.1;
 *   - cache write x1.25 (5-minute lifetime) or x2 (1-hour lifetime);
 *   - input and output x1 (output's own price is a cost question; usd stays the cost figure).
 * The sample carries no cache lifetime (Claude Code's OTel counts one cacheCreation), so a write
 * is weighed x1.25 unless the sample says how much of it was 1-hour (`cacheCreation1h`).
 * The raw figure is kept beside it (fleet.json `tokensRaw`, the card's tooltip), and every token
 * CAP still counts raw: this changes what is shown, not when a breaker trips.
