/**
 * HISTORY-VIEW-169: the per-agent History tab's wire types.
 *
 * The terminal's scrollback is not a record of the conversation (resize repaints and
 * transcript replays land in it as stale frames; TERMINAL-SCROLLBACK-WHY.md), so the
 * History tab reads the provider's OWN transcript file instead and shows it as a small,
 * normalised list of items. Main resolves the file from the agent id alone; the renderer
 * never names a path.
 *
 * CURSORS ARE BYTE OFFSETS of line starts in that file. The files are append-only, so an
 * offset stays valid while the file grows, and paging older and following newer are both
 * a single seek. The one exception is a resync cursor INSIDE a line too long to skip in one
 * request (historyTail RESYNC): it is passed back unchanged and the reader carries on from it.
