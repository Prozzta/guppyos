/**
 * READS-QUIET-NOREPLY (1.1.81): which delivered mail may wait for the agent's next real turn
 * instead of starting one.
 *
 * Every wake re-sends the agent's whole conversation (god: up to ~290k per turn), and on
 * 2026-10-02 176 of 348 mail wakes carried only FYI mail (quiet-time on/off, status relays).
 * For an `inject` agent (Claude, Codex, AGY) the mail BODIES never ride the wake: the hooks
 * surface every delivered id on the next UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse, woken for or not. So a
 * quiet message only has to stay out of the wake coordinator's pending set; it reaches the agent
 * on its next real turn, or after QUIET_MAIL_HOLD_MIN_DEFAULT minutes at most, when the whole
 * held batch is released as one ordinary wake.
 *
 * QUIET = ALL of:
 *   - the recipient's mail mode is `inject` (the others read mail BECAUSE of the wake prompt);
 *   - act `inform` or `agree` (done is how results come back: it always wakes, god c95516);
 *   - no reply required;
 *   - a sender that is not the Human, the breaker, the floor digest or a harness sender;
 *   - the sender did not ask for `"wake": "now"`;
 *   - it does not ANSWER the recipient's own ask (Jim B1): an agree or inform whose in_reply_to is a
 *     message the recipient sent as a request/query/propose or with requires_reply. That is the go
 *     signal an idle agent is waiting for (god's "approved" to Jim was an agree).
 * Everything else wakes exactly as before. Pure: no clock, no I/O.
