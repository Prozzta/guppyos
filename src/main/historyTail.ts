/**
 * HISTORY-VIEW-169: a bounded line reader for append-only JSONL transcripts.
 *
 * A Codex rollout reaches 100+ MB (Dwight's reached 132 MB), so nothing here ever reads a
 * file whole:
 *  - BACKWARD from a byte offset (the tail, or an older page), in CHUNK-sized reads, and
 *    only until the caller has enough or the byte budget is spent;
 *  - FORWARD from a byte offset (following growth), with the same budget.
 *
 * The limits, per request:
 *  - `budget`: bytes read before the reader stops at the next line boundary.
 *  - `maxLine`: a line longer than this is SKIPPED, never assembled or parsed (Codex
 *    `compacted` records run to many MB). Skipping still has to find the line's end, so
 *    an oversized line may read up to `skipMax` more before the reader gives up at a
 *    boundary.
 *
 * Offsets are BYTE offsets of line starts. A line is split at 0x0A, which never occurs
 * inside a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence, so each line decodes on its own; a trailing CR
 * (CRLF files) is dropped. An unterminated last line is one still being written: it is
 * never returned, and the window's `end` stops before it, so the next forward read picks
 * it up whole.
 *
 * Growth is detected by SIZE, not mtime: on Windows a Codex rollout's mtime can stay at
 * its creation time while the file grows.
 *
 * RESYNC (HISTORY-169-AUDIT F1): a line longer than even `budget + skipMax` cannot be
 * skipped in one request. Rather than stopping at the same boundary forever (follow and
 * older paging would stall, re-reading the whole budget every time), the reader then hands
 * back a cursor INSIDE that line: the furthest byte it scanned. A cursor that is not a line
 * start (the byte before it is not 0x0A) can only be one of these, so the next read starts
 * in skip mode and carries on to the line's end (forward) or start (backward). Such a
 * cursor is only ever produced here, and only inside a line already judged oversized.
